## Windy Gridworld

The environment consists of a 7x10 gridworld. The start state is (3,0) and goal state is (3,7). In the middle region the resultant next states are shifted upward by a “wind,” the strength of which varies from column to column. This is an undiscounted episodic task with rewards of -1 until the goal is reached.
